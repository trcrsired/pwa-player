# PWA Player

This project is my hands-on exploration of Progressive Web Apps — with a focus on pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the browser.

What emerged is a fully offline-capable video player with a binary size of just 200KB. Compared to traditional native players like VLC or SMPlayer, this underscores a broader truth: modern app development is bloated, and the browser is quietly reclaiming ground as a legitimate platform for lean, high-performance tools.

This isn't just a player — it's a statement.
